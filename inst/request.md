Re: Public Records Request for “the following records:

Motor vehicle violation citations and warnings both civil and criminal issued between Jan 1, 2011 and Jan 1, 2021 by the Boston Police Department.
I request the data contain all fields found in the Massachusetts Uniform Citation that may be disclosed without personally identifying violators. I request that the data be provided in two formats: 1) in a flat file format e.g. Comma-separated Values (CSV) or Tab-separated Values (TSV), and 2) in a searchable excel file. If it is easier to produce the records in batches, for example year by year, I am open to that as well.

```
